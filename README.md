# First-Hackpad
This is my first hackpad being made for the Hackclub Blueprint program. This is also my first time using any sort of this software so I am still learning!

# Challenges
This was made in one night and it was my very first time using softwares such as KiCad and Fusion, so don't expect it to be perfect or anything special, but I am proud of it!
